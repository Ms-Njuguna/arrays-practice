## 📸 Instagram-Style Follow Button (JS Practice)

Welcome to my mini project! 🎉  
This is a beginner-friendly simulation of the Instagram "Follow" feature — built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**, no frameworks, no backend, just pure front-end fun. 😎

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This project lets users follow a profile by:
- Clicking a **Follow** button
- Typing in their name (via a popup)
- Automatically adding their name to a **followers list** displayed on the page

> Think of it like a baby version of the Instagram follow function — built from scratch to practice arrays, functions, and DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the project folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click the "Follow" button and enter a name
4. Watch your name appear in the list of followers 🎉

> No installations, no setup — just open and run.
